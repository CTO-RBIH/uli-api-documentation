The Farm Yield Report API provides comprehensive farm health parameters such as irrigation, water body, ground water, minimum support price, crop yield and weather conditions based on advanced algorithms and geospatial data. This service supports both single and multi-land parcel analysis across multiple Indian states, enabling precision agriculture insights for agricultural lending and risk assessment.

This service is part of the Unified Lending Interface (ULI) and is powered by SatSure Analytics India Pvt Ltd, providing cutting-edge agricultural intelligence through satellite imagery and machine learning algorithms.
