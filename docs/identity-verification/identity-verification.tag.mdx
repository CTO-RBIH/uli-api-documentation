The Identity Service APIs are modular, purpose-built tools designed to streamline KYC and user onboarding processes, enabling fast, secure, and scalable identity verification, regardless of your industry or business model.

These APIs provide a comprehensive suite of solutions that support every stage of the onboarding and authentication journey.

## Key Features

- **Name Comparison**: Compares two names and returns a similarity match score
- **Address Comparison**: Compares two address strings and calculates a match score  
- **Face Liveness Detection**: Determines whether the presented face is from a live person, preventing spoofing attempts
- **Face Match**: Compares two facial images and returns a confidence score indicating match accuracy
- **Geocode API**: Transforms a structured or free-form address into precise geographic coordinates
- **Reverse Geocode API**: Converts geographic coordinates into a human-readable address

## How It Works

1. **Data Collection**: Gather customer information requiring verification
2. **API Selection**: Choose appropriate verification endpoints based on data type
3. **Secure Transmission**: Send encrypted data using HMAC SHA-256 signatures
4. **Real-time Processing**: Receive immediate verification results and confidence scores
5. **Decision Making**: Use results to automate approval workflows and fraud detection

## Service Information

- **API Version**: 1.1
- **Environment Support**: Sandbox and Production
- **Authentication**: JWT Token with 6-hour validity (sandbox) / 12-hour (production)
