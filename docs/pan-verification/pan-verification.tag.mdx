The PAN Verification API service allows verification of the details and validity of a Permanent Account Number (PAN) against Income Tax Department records. This service is offered by Protean eGov Technologies Ltd, providing secure and reliable PAN validation for financial institutions and lenders.

## Key Features

- **PAN Validity Check**: Verify if a PAN exists and is valid in the Income Tax Department database

- **Seeding Status**: Check if PAN is operative or inoperative
