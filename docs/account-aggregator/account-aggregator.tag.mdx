The Account Aggregator (AA) serves as an intermediary between a User or a FIU and Financial Information Providers (such as banks, securities, insurance, pensions and other account/finance management service providers). Application Programming interfaces enable AA to manage the lifecycle of consent artifacts through the Consent Flow API.

The Account Aggregator API service allows to get consent of the application and fetches account details from multiple banks.

## Key Features

- **Consent Management**: Handle consent artifacts as per ReBIT FIU 2.0.0 specifications
- **Multi-Bank Integration**: Fetch account details from multiple financial institutions
- **Secure Data Exchange**: Base64 encoded requests with HMAC signatures and JWS authentication
- **Multiple AA Providers**: Support for 7 major Account Aggregator providers
- **Enhanced Security**: JWS signatures and client API keys for robust authentication
- **Pass-through Architecture**: Seamless integration without examining specific consent types
